# FilenameToDateModified

I found a bunch of screenshots on an old pc. 
When I transferred the files to my phone the date modified property of the files where set to the date of the transfer (off by 10 years :)). 
Thus when the pictures were uploaded to google photos, they did not appear correctly in the timeline.
Instead of going back to the old pc i decided to piece together this little utility.
